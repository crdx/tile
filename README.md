# tile

**tile** is a game written in plain JavaScript.

It was written as part of a University assignment a long long time ago.

[You can try it here](https://crdx.github.io/tile).

* Any options that differ from the defaults will be placed in the URL, so hotlinking to puzzle configurations is possible.
* The Image URL can be any image, relative or absolute. [Like this](https://crdx.github.io/tile/?gridWidth=8&gridHeight=8&imageUrl=https://raw.github.com/crdx/tile/main/static/thing.jpg).
* [An animated GIF works, too](https://crdx.github.io/tile/?gridWidth=8&imageUrl=https://raw.github.com/crdx/tile/main/static/anim.gif).
